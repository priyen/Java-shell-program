What did I do last time?
	-  Discussed possible designs for file system, which is what our file/folder database is based around.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Meeting tomorrow to finally get a good backbone for the filesystem ready

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Still having trouble on current implementation of the folder/filesystem
