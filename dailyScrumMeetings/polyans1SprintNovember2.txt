What did I do last time?
- Finished A2A with my team

What do I plan to do now?
- Start working on the get url command
- Document all the methods written with Javadoc
- Update CRC cards
- Ensure unit tests (JUnit) are written as project is being worked on (not all in the end)

Am I blocked on anything?
- Need to discuss design with the whole team and update our CRC Cards
