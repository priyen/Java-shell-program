What did I do last time?
- Make all error messages use stderr instead of stdout
- Fully finish grep command class
- Continue to debug LS for "double line issues" 

What do I plan to do now?
- Continue work on grep (found some issues)
- Help out with fixing "extra line" issues with redirection

Am I blocked on anything?
- need grep jUnits
