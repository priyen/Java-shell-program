What did I do last time?
- Contributed to code for Classes: File, Folder
- Wrote class FileSystem

What do I plan to do now?
- Start working on some commands classes
- Test basic functionality of FileSystem class
 
Am I blocked on anything?
- Testing FileSystem without a jShell is difficult, but will do it by making a alternative temporary 'main' program to test basic functionality
