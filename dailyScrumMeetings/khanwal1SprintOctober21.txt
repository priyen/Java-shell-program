What did I do last time?
	- Finalized a filesystem design to base command classes around
	- Completed first revision of CommandParser Class

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start working on Copy and Move classes.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Figure out how move and copy classes may use inheritance inorder to keep design efficient.
