What did I do last time?
- Meeting to discuss new parts of the project

What do I plan to do now?
- Make Ls work for rescursive flag
- Redesign mkdir so that it returns a string
- Redesign many classes to return string (to prepare for ">" use in commands).

Am I blocked on anything?
- A lot of classes were designed without consideration that ">" might be used in the future part of the project. (We didn't know 2B would have this and we wouldve designed classes differently if we knew this). This is causing a lot of issues at the moment.
