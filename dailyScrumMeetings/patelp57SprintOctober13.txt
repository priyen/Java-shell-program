What did I do last time?
- N/A (first sprint meeting)

What do I plan to do now?
- Write basic code for file class (will be included in CRC design regardless if not finalized)
- Contribute code to JShell command parsing
 
Am I blocked on anything?
- Need a finalized CRC design to make progress (without it cannot code relavent things)
