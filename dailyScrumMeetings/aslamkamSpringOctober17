What did I do last time?
	- completed file and folder classes
	- created methods with these classes that will be very useful in commands 
	relating to pwd, ls, and just dir-related commands
What I intend to do now?
	- change the crc design. Its a stupid design that if I stick to, the code 
	will become very complicated. 
	- I guess complete other classes and think of an efficient way to implement
	that does not have a huge blob of system.out.println.
	
Am I blocked on anything?
	- let's see, writing the code for mv and cp will be a huge pain
