What did I do last time?
- Start working on some commands classes
- Test basic functionality of FileSystem class

What do I plan to do now?
- Modify FileSystem to act more like a "root" folder along and tree structure vs parent-child directory tracking
- Modify Folder class to use Hashmap's instead of arrays
 
Am I blocked on anything?
- Undecisiviesness about responsibility of FileSystem class (to be decided tomorrow at a group meeting)
