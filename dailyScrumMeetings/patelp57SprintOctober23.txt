What did I do last time?
- Contribute to command parser (try and make a method that converts paths with special symbols like /../.. to paths with text only (but added this code functionality to FileSystem and Folder class) - getFolderFromPath and getFileFromName return null when path doesnt exist
- Made mkdir work with ".." paths and also error when a path doesn't exist

What do I plan to do now?
- Helpout with jShell as that is something I also need
- Helpout with echo class

Am I blocked on anything?
- Need a more functional jShell to test various mkdir and filesystem functionalities
