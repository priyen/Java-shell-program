What did I do last time?
	- First Phase of Command Implementation has started, ls, cd, pwd and exit are now working, given there are no syntax errors.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start working on Copy and Move classes, which are more complex than previously thought.

Am I blocked on anything?
- Better implementation of command parser to handle for syntax errors. 	
- Figure out how move and copy classes may use inheritance inorder to keep design efficient. Further all possible scenarios when file and folders are being copied.
