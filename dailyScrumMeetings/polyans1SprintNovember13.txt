What did I do last time?
- Fixed my previous errors in pushD/popD
- Small changes in get command
- Updated CRC design

What do I plan to do now?
- Make sure PB is up to date
- Ensure A2B functions properly/JUnits are thorough and pass all tests

Am I blocked on anything?
- Redirection is still not working as we all hope (small bugs)
