What did I do last time?
- Modify FileSystem to act more like a "root" folder along and tree structure vs parent-child directory tracking
- Modify Folder class to use Hashmap's instead of arrays
- Added a lot of useful methods in FileSystem that will be used by other classes
- Made FileSystem non-static
- Made the mkdir command class
- Group meeting in person to discuss things

What do I plan to do now?
- Contribute to command parser (try and make a method that converts paths with special symbols like /../.. to paths with text only
 
Am I blocked on anything?
- Nothing blocking my progress at this moment
