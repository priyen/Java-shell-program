What did I do last time?
- Figured out new design
- Thought about way to implement new commands (especially grep - the bonus)

What do I plan to do now?
- Update/finalize CRC cards
- Work on a few commands (get, ls)

Am I blocked on anything?
- Was studying for the midterm and didn't have much time for coding
