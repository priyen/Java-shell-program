What did I do last time?
	- Discussed and finalized current CRC card and design
	- Wrote out text files which are to be used for the man
 	  command, yet to be uploaded. 

What do I plan to do now?
	- Assist with Jshell and FileSystem Classes.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- FileSystem class, which stores the actual folder and file structure needs to be finalized inorder to determine how 
	  commands will be manipulating folders and files.
