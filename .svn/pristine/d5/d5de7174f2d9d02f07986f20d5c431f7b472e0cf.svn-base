What did I do last time?
- Fixed echo related issues, it was failing for a lot of test cases and re-wrote how it parses and get's arguments in CommandParser specifically for echo.
- jUnit for classes: CommandMkdir, FileSystem, CommandCd, CommandPwd
- Helped out with productBacklog
- Removed redundant code in some classes that wasn't taking advantage of some methods in FileSystem
- Finalize project, finishing touches, comments, etc

What do I plan to do now?
- Project is done

Am I blocked on anything?
- Project is done
