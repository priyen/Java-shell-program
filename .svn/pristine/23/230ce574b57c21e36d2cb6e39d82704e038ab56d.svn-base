What did I do last time?
	- Discussed possible designs for file system, which is what our file/folder database is based around.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finalize one of two potential file system designs after which command class coding can begin

Am I blocked on anything?
	- FileSystem class, which stores the actual folder and file structure still need finalizing in order to base commmand classesaround.
