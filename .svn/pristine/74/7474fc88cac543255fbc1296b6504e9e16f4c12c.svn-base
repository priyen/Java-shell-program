What I have done?
updated the backlog

What I intend to do?
Correct the crc design and have an independent root folder. Complete echo and 
do as much as I can till the deadline.

Am I stuck on anything?

Now that's it so close to the due date, I will try to get as much work done as 
possible; if I'm stuck on something, I'll fix it myself and I don't care if its
sloppy.
