What did I do last time?
- Make Ls work for flag -r
- Helped with CommandParser, specifically getFlags function
- Modified jShell to better handle flags
- Started on grep command class
- Made a class called outPrintStream to capture redirection
- Modified all classes to use outPrintStream instead of System.out
- Made and tested and ensured redirection works with appropriate commands

What do I plan to do now?
- Make all error messages use stderr instead of stdout
- Fully finish grep command class
- Continue to debug LS for "double line issues" 

Am I blocked on anything?
- Nothing blocking progress at the moment
