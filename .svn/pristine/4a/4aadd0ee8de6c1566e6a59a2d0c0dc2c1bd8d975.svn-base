//Sprint 8 Backlog  
November 10 to November 14


Product Backlog items to be implemented:


a) - As a JShell user I want to see all the contents of a directory recursively 
(Estimated time to complete: 3 hours)

b) - As a JShell user I can save previously visited directories so that I can return to them
quickly by removing the last visited directory
(Estimated time to complete: 5 hours)

c) - As a JShell user, I can capture the output of every command which has output into
a file
(Estimated time to complete: 6 hours)

d) - As a JShell user I can delete a directory and I am prompted whether I would 
like to remove each content inside the directory (provided it contains them)
	- I can also specify to not confirm whether I want to remove and simply delete it
(Estimated time to complete: 5 hours)


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1  (JShell, pushD) - Create framework a push directory capability
a-2  (JShell, popD) - Prototype the popD command for directories
b-1  (JShell, CommandLs) - Update CommandLs so that it lists all the contents in a directory recursively
b-2  (JShell, Redirect) -  Create functionality for all (able) commands to write their output into a file
c-1  (JShell, CommandRm) - Fully implement the remove command
d-1  (JUnit - CommandGetUrl) Add more JUnit tests for the updated CommandLs
d-2  (JUnit - CommandRm) Create JUnit tests for the updated CommandGetUrl
