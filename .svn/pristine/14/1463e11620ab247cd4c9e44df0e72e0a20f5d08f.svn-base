What did I do last time?
	- discussed with my group on how to change the crc design
	- coded an alternate design to show what I meant
What will I do next?
	- start coding a couple of cmd classes
Am I blocked on anything?
	- need filesystem and folder to be modified to agree to 	the new design all of us have agreed upon
