What did I do last time?
- Fully implemented pushD
- Fully implemented popD
- Modified CommandCd and JShell to work with new commands pushd/popd

What do I plan to do now?
- Make sure all commands are working properly
- Ensure JUnits get completed

Am I blocked on anything?
- Need JUnits to be done to prove correctness
