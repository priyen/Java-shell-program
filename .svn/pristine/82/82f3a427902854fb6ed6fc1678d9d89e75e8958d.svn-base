What did I do last time?
- Write basic code for file class (will be included in CRC design regardless if not finalized)
- Contribute code to JShell command parsing

What do I plan to do now?
- Write basic code for filesystem class (will be included in CRC design regardless if not finalized)
- Write basic code for folder class
 
Am I blocked on anything?
- Not yet as I am writing the "back-end" classes
