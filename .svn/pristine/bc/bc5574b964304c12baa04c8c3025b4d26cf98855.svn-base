What did I do last time?
- Created capability for ls to handle multiple arguments (e.g ls a b c)
- Created the append in echo (made sure it worked on newlines correctly)
- Created Javadoc for some methods
- Made sure commands did not crash - made editions to CommandParser
- Renamed all commands to be consistent

What do I plan to do now?
- Create JUnit testing for remaining classes
- Finish Javadoc
- Debug code
- Finalize project and put finishing touches everywhere
- Need to update CRC design

Am I blocked on anything?
- Bugs being found in code
