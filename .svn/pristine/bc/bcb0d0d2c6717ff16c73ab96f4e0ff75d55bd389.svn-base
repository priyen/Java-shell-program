Interactive Backlog 
(Note: This is an optional log created to be a bit more interactive with the commands)
===========================================================================================

So basically, we have a guy called Max. Max is very picky, he likes things 
organized. 
So we told Max, "Okay, we'll create a filesystem that does that for you."
... In the future Max is trying out our filesystem.

He wonders what type of commands are accessible for him. Max types in "man" 
into the command line and gets a list of commands which he can enter.

Max types into the command line "mkdir Max".
Max says: "Cool, this thing allows me to create folders! Now I can store all
my important stuff inside them, hmmm, but I wonder if its actually there."

Max types in "ls":
The folder name "Max" pops onto the screen.
"What else can I do", wonders Max.
Max decides to create another folder called "Maxy" and types in "cd" to 
go into it - "Wow" says Max - "this is great".

After all the excitement Max forgets which directory he was in!
So being the bright young fellow he is, Max discovers the pwd command using 
the man feature and pinpoints his location in the filesystem.

Max types in "echo cool"
output: cool

"That's great! Now I don't have to hike to a cave to hear myself echo. But
I wonder if I can record my echos into a file."
/# echo "this" >> cool
/# echo "filesystem" > cool
/# ls
cool
"Now I want to read cool"
/# cat cool
filesystem

"Darn it!! I put my cool file into the wrong folder...Let me find a command to move it.."
Max enters "mv cool Maxy/cool" and moves the file where he wants it.

"Oh my - I wonder if I can copy this file, I know I can get quite 
careless sometimes!" While in Maxy, Max types in "cp cool coolBackUp" 
and makes a copy of the file he worked so hard on.


"Amazing, I must give a bonus to the guys who designed such an awesome filesystem."
